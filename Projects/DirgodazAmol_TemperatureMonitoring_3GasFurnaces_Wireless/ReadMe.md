## Wireless Temperature Monitoring for 3 Gas Furnaces with Graphs in LabVIEW
   
The system consists of 3 transmitter boards and 1 receiver board.  
Each transmitter is installed on a separate gas furnace.  
The receiver is connected to the PC and sends the collected data to LabVIEW for display and analysis.  
The devices communicate wirelessly in a mesh network using NRF24L01 modules.
